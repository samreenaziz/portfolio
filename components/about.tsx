            <p className="mb-3 text-left">
                &emsp;&emsp;After graduating from a <span className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]">Master's of Applied Science in Biomedical Engineering </span> program (2018 - 2022) at Carleton University,
                I worked as a <span className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]">Data Scientist and Technical Consultant at IBM, Aviva Insurance, and Validere Technologies </span> - industries
                ranging from general consulting, insurance, and oil and gas. <span className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]">My passion, has, however been in the digital health space. </span>

            <p className="mb-3 text-left">
                &emsp;&emsp;While completing my <span className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]">Bachelors degree in Neuroscience and Mental Health Studies from the University of Toronto</span>, there was a shortage of mental health resources and education for youth at a time when university/college mental health crises were at an all-time high - I
                put together <span className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]">wireframes of a mental health support and education app, rallying students, the Bayshore Health Sciences and professors into my support system </span>.

            <p className="mb-3  text-left">
                &emsp;&emsp;In 2024, I decided to invest in my ambitions and interests, embarking on a <a className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]" target="_blank" href="https://brainstation.io/online/software-engineering-bootcamp">Software Engineering diploma with BrainStation ðŸ”—</a>.
