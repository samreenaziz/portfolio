            &emsp;&emsp;After graduating from a <span className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]">Master's of Applied Science in Biomedical Engineering </span> program (2018 - 2022) at Carleton University,
            I worked as a <span className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]">Data Scientist and Technical Consultant at IBM, Aviva Insurance, and Validere Technologies </span> - industries

            &emsp;&emsp;My rewarding graduate thesis involved applying <span className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]">Machine Learning and Data Science with MATLAB and Python </span> to develop a <a className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]" target="_blank" href="https://repository.library.carleton.ca/concern/etds/vh53ww68b">non-invasive motion detection and classificiation model for neonatal patient monitoring ðŸ”— </a>.

            &emsp;&emsp;In 2024, I decided to invest in my ambitions and interests, embarking on a <a className="font-medium text-[#D81B60]" target="_blank" href="https://brainstation.io/online/software-engineering-bootcamp">Software Engineering diploma with BrainStation ðŸ”—</a>.
